Unofficial Rust Bindings for X-Ways Forensics X-Tension API


## Description

This project provides Rust bindings for the X-Ways Forensics X-Tension API, 
allowing developers to create powerful forensic extensions in Rust.

By leveraging the high performance and safety features of Rust, 
this binding enables seamless integration with the X-Tension API, 
facilitating the development of custom forensic tools and automation solutions 
for digital forensics workflows.


## Project Goals
- Translating all relevant features of XWF X-Tension API into Rust Language
- Providing an object-oriented and high-level abstraction layer 
  to the official X-Tension C API
- Use idiomatic Rust features to facilitate a safe, robust and intuitive way of using the API
- Simplify project setup for new X-Tensions
- Identify possible problems and bugs within the XWF API functions
